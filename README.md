# Su-So
Sudoku Solver.

While I got my hands dirty on the "Digit classification dataset problem" ,I wondered where could I possibly use it . One idea which hit my head was to solve a sudoku. I could just take a snap of the sudoku from the newspaper and the computer could solve it for me , I learnt that backtracking would work well to solve the sudoku but I had to inupt the numbers, which was not at all cool. I also found out that I could build a Computer Vision solution to it , which could possibly predict the digits and empty spaces. That's what it all took to start #Su-So.
